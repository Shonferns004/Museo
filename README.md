- Search & Filters: Allow users to search monuments by name, category, or location.

- Image & Media Management: Upload and manage photos/videos for exhibits.

- Responsive Improvements: Optimize layouts for mobile and tablet users.

- Multi-language Support: Add i18n for a broader audience.

- Testing & CI/CD: Unit and integration tests with Jest/React Testing Library, plus GitHub Actions for automated builds.

- Deployment: Host both apps on services like Vercel, Netlify, or Docker containers for production use.
